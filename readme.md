This is a port of the .NET core of my Sudoku game that is published in the Windows Phone marketplace.

I started porting it to JavaScript in hopes of publishing it as a Windows 8 app, but so far there isn't any WinJS specific code. It only has a dependency on Underscore.js for the code and QUnit and jQuery for the tests.
